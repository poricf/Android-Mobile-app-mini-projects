# Mobile Apps and Computing Course Projects

This repository contains two Android mobile app projects developed as part of the ASTU (Adama Science and Technology University) Mobile Apps and Computing course:

1. **BMI Calculator**
2. **Astu Web App**

## BMI Calculator

### Description
The BMI Calculator is an Android app that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their height and weight. The app provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to input their information and view their BMI result, along with a classification of their weight status.

### Features
- User-friendly interface with input fields for height and weight
- Calculation of BMI based on the provided height and weight
- Display of the calculated BMI value
- Classification of the user's weight status (e.g., underweight, normal, overweight, obese)
- Optionally, the app may provide additional information or guidance based on the user's BMI result

### Usage
1. Launch the BMI Calculator app on your Android device.
2. Enter your height and weight in the respective input fields.
3. Tap the "Calculate" button to compute your BMI.
4. The app will display your BMI value and the corresponding weight status classification.

### Technologies Used
- Android SDK
- Java programming language
- Android UI components (e.g., EditText, Button, TextView)
- Basic arithmetic operations for BMI calculation

## Astu Web App

### Description
The Astu Web App is an Android application that serves as a mobile client for interacting with a web-based application called "Astu". This project was developed as part of the ASTU Mobile Apps and Computing course.

### Features
- User authentication (login/logout) to access the Astu web app
- Ability to view and interact with the data and functionality provided by the Astu web application
- Optimized mobile user interface for a seamless experience on Android devices
- Potential offline capabilities for limited access to Astu features without an internet connection
- Synchronization of user data between the Android app and the Astu web application

### Usage
1. Install the Astu Web App on your Android device.
2. Launch the app and authenticate with your Astu web app credentials.
3. Navigate through the app's interface to access the various features and functionalities of the Astu system.
4. Interact with the Astu web app's data and perform actions as needed, directly from your Android device.

### Technologies Used
- Android SDK
- Java programming language
- Android UI components (e.g., activities, fragments, views)
- Integration with the Astu web application through APIs or other communication protocols
- Potential use of local data storage (e.g., SQLite, Room) for offline capabilities
